Trying to get the first and last element by finding max and min element in the array and using the AP formula to get the first and last element
​
General Form of AP  a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d, . . .
The nth term of AP  an = a + [(n – 1) × d] should be equal to last element)
Sum of n terms in AP  S = n/2[2a + (n − 1) × d]
Sum of all terms in a finite AP with the last term as 'l' n/2(a + l)

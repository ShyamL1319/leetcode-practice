**Just to mention that triangle property is the key of solution
​
Triangle is 3 side figure as when we join three side it form a triangle but there is condition for it
​
1- The sum of any two side is always greater than third side.
​
2- Diffrence of any two side is always smaller than third side.
​
These two is the basic property of the triangle****
